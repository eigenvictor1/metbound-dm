The model of particle interaction has to be defined in the    
CalcHEP format,   Comput.Phys.Commun. 184 (2013) 1729-1769 //arXiv:arXiv:1207.6082[hep-ph] 

1. The model is defined in the directory ./work/models via the following files:

	extlib1.mdl  func1.mdl  lgrng1.mdl  prtcls1.mdl  vars1.mdl 

   The model files were generated with FeynRules. The names of all particles in the dark sectors
   that can potentially be a dark matter candidate  should  start with "~". 

2. To check your model, go to work/  and launch 

   	./calchep 

   Use "Check Model"  to get  information  about   model inconsistencies. 
  
3. External constraints. 
   If your model has external functions  they have to be realized 
   as a  library in lib/aLib.a. If your external functions do not need other 
   libraries and are written in C, then put this code in the lib/
   subdirectory. The library will be compiled automatically.  In more complicated case,
   improve  lib/Makefile
 
4. The main program for the parameter scan is written in the main program file main.c

5. Compilation of executable is launched by 

    gmake  main=<name of your main file>

    If gmake is absent, use make. We assume that in such case make works like gmake.

6. The main program for the parameter scan can be called via

	./main <inputfile.txt> <outputfile.txt>

   The output will be written to the text file in CSV format. The input file contains the
   details of the parameter space to scan. It contains the minimum, maximum and step values for
   the parameters YChi, mS, mD, ThetaY. The lines must be in the form

	YChi_max=<value>
	YChi_min=<value>
	YChi_step=<value>

   etc.

7. The parameter space can be changed in the main.c file in the for-loops. Before recompilation, 
   make sure to clean the build files with

	make clean

   called from within this directory.
